# Project 3
The prevalence of asthma along with influenza and pneumococcal rates among asthma patients throughout the United States in 2021

Research purpose:
    
    The prevalence of asthma in each state
    
    Which state has the hightest prevalence of asthma?
    
    Between the two vaccines (influenza and pneumococcal) researched, which vaccine has a higher rate of adoption for those diagnosed with asthma?

Dataset to be used:

    U.S. Chronic Disease Indications (CDI), 2023 release

    https://data.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-CDI-2023-Release/g4ie-h725/data_preview
    
    This dataset is sourced from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and includes data from 2010 to 2021 about chronic disease states for the entire United States including Puerto Rico and Guam.
    
To clean the data, Python and SQL were used.

Analysis results:

    Highest influenza vaccination rate is Massachusetts at 60.55%.
    Lowest influenza vaccination rate is Guam at 29.1%.
    Highest pneumococcal vaccination rate is Wisconsin at 49.2%.
    Lowest pneumococcal vaccination rate is Pacific Islands at 18.65%.
    
    Highest prevalence of asthma is South Dakota.
    Lowest prevalence of asthma is the Virgin Islands.

Analysis summary:

    The influenza vaccine has a higher adoption rate than pneumococcal vaccine.
    Asthma is more prevalent in the north-eastern United States.
    Approximately 35% of asthma patients over 18 have received the pneumococcal vaccine nationwide.
    Approximately 44% of asthma patients over 18 have received the influenza vaccine nationwide.
    
Limitations:
    
    Due to the enormous size of the dataset, we limited the project to researching the two vaccination rates and general asthma prevalence in the year 2021.

Ethical Considerations:
 
    Throughout the project, ethical considerations will be considered, particularly concerning data privacy and representation. All personal data will be anonymized, and the visualizations will aim to present data accurately without misleading interpretations.
